# 1. Register at http://icon.is.tue.mpg.de/ or https://cape.is.tue.mpg.de/
# 2. Download CAPE testset (Easy: 50, Hard: 100)
bash fetch_cape.sh 

```

## Command

```bash

# model_type: 
#   "pifu"            reimplemented PIFu
#   "pamir"           reimplemented PaMIR
#   "icon-filter"     ICON w/ global encoder (continous local wrinkles)
#   "icon-nofilter"   ICON w/o global encoder (correct global pose)


python -m apps.train-MR -cfg ./configs/train/mlif.yaml -test
# TIP: reduce "mcube_res" as 128 in apps/train.py for faster evaluation
```

The qualitative results are located at `./results/MLIF`
